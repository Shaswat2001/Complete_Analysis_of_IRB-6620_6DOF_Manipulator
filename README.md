# Complete_Analysis_of_IRB6620

In the given project Kinematic, Dynamic analysis and trajectory planning of IRB 6620 is presented. Just to give a glimpse of what lies ahead. (Detailed Explanation is given in the reports ahead)

## Kinematic and Dynamic Analysis

To perform Kinematic and Dynamic analysis, both analytical approach and numerical validation approach is used. Some of the results are shown-

## Trajectory Planning

MATLAB is used to perform trajectory planning of IRB 6620. Trapezoidal, quintic and cubic time scalings are used in the simulation.
